            Steps
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef, salt, and black pepper in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Add onion, bell pepper, carrot, and garlic to beef; cook and stir until onion is lightly browned, about 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix tomatoes, tomato sauce, mushrooms, Worcestershire sauce, and brown sugar into beef and vegetable mixture; season with salt and black pepper. Cook on low until liquid is reduced and flavors have blended, about 45 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and transfer pasta to a 9x13-inch casserole dish.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spoon cream of mushroom soup over pasta; top with beef and vegetable mixture. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese on top.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbling and Cheddar cheese is melted, about 45 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
